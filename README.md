# Arabic Character Recognition (Deep CNN)

This project implements a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) in TensorFlow/Keras for recognizing Arabic handwritten characters.  
It includes full preprocessing, model design, training, and evaluation pipeline.

---

## Project Description
- Developed a CNN-based model for **Arabic handwritten character recognition**.  
- Applied preprocessing steps: image rotation, flipping, normalization.  
- Built a deep CNN with multiple convolutional, pooling, batch normalization, and dropout layers.  
- Trained with **ModelCheckpoint** to save the best-performing weights.  
- Achieved **96.3% accuracy** on the test dataset.
